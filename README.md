# Hot/Cold

A ridiculous little application that yells HOT or COLD at you as you get closer or further away. Uses iBeacons and MultiPeer Connectivity.

Nowhere near done yet, follow along as I build it at [the dev blog](http://ampersandsoftworks.com/tag/hotcold/).

TODO: Figure out a licence for this hunk of code.
